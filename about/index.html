<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  Connelly Project Space is a family-run experimental art space based in South London, operating from the most unexpected of locations: a backyard chicken coop.
</p>
<p>
  Founded in 2025 by the Connelly family—Jimmy, Zara, Elena, Maura and Margaret (the latter two being chickens)—the project began as a whimsical idea and quickly took flight. Since then, it has hatched a range of exhibitions exploring identity, landscape, humour, intergenerational and interspecies collaboration.
</p>
<p>
  The gallery’s first outing as the ICA – Institute of Chicken Art – featured a solo show by Zara Connelly. Since then, we’ve grown into an ever-evolving platform for artists, chickens, and thinkers working beyond the white cube.
</p>
<p>
  Our proudest moment so far? Collaborating with the visionary curator and artist Kenny Schachter, alongside Maura and Margaret, in our current headline exhibition, <em>Chicken Stingel</em>.
</p>
<p>
  We welcome suggestions and spirited debate. This is art at the top of the pecking order.
