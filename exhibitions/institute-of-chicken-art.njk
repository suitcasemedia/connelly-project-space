    We were thrilled to announce our very first exhibition in the world’s
    first art gallery inside a chicken coop.
  </p>
  <p>
    This inaugural exhibition presented contemporary art at the very top
    of the pecking order, with a solo show by the immensely talented Zara
    Connelly. Her work explored portraiture, landscape, identity, and what
    it meant to be a chicken in 2025.

    suggestions. Contenders included:
