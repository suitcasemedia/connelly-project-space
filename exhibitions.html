      <h2>Current Exhibition</h2>
      <h3>The First Ever Art Gallery Inside of a Chicken Coop</h3>
      <p>By Kenny Schachter, Maura & Margaret<br>
      Sunday May 25th, 2025, 2 – 5 pm<br>
      The Connelly Family Project Space<br>
      Flat 4 Vincent Court, 199 New Park Road<br>
      London SW2 4HP</p>

      <p>The one-day-only live painting performance will entail a series of canvases and digitally developed copper casts. Installed primarily in a chicken coop, the works by Kenny Schachter, Maura and Margaret, a pair of <em>Gallus gallus domesticus</em>—also known as domestic chickens—will be on view by appointment on weekends through June 21 subsequent to the opening. With the generous support of Zara, Elena & Jimmy Connelly.</p>

      <p>The jumping off point for the exhibit is a series of Rudolf Stingel works begun in 2002, on large-scale panels of insulation material (Celotex Tuff-R) affixed to gallery and museum walls where viewers were encouraged to graffiti the spaces via scratching, writing, or otherwise leaving marks on the malleable surfaces. A decade later, in 2012, the artist readdressed the brittle pieces by casting them in electroformed copper, plated in nickel and gold.</p>

      <p>Approaching the hens as sentient, living creatures and collaborators rather than fungible foodstuff, a group of micro-sized canvases were coated in edible glue, covered in feed and placed in Maura and Margaret’s coop. The results of the collaborative pecking process of the birds consuming the food will be followed (at a later date) by digital scans of the canvases cast and coated in silver and gold finishes, echoing Stingel’s body of work.</p>
