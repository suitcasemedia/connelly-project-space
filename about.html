      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Connelly Project Space is a family-run experimental art space based in South London, operating from the most unexpected of locations: a backyard chicken coop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded in 2025 by the Connelly family—Jimmy, Zara, Elena, Maura and Margaret (the latter two being chickens)—the project began as a whimsical idea and quickly took flight. Since then, it has hatched a range of exhibitions exploring identity, landscape, humour, intergenerationsal and interspecies collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gallery’s first outing as the <strong>ICA – Institute of Chicken Art</strong> featured a solo show by Zara Connelly. We’ve since grown into an ever-evolving platform for artists, chickens, and thinkers working beyond the white cube.
      </p>
      <p>
        We welcome alternative naming suggestions and spirited debate. This is, after all, art at the top of the pecking order.
